# CUDA K-Means — Reproducible, Benchmarkable, and Resume-Proof

This project implements **K-Means clustering** with both:
- A **single-threaded CPU baseline**
- A **CUDA-accelerated** version (GPU), with kernels for assignment and centroid recomputation

It includes **reproducible benchmarking** and **numeric verification** (inertia comparison), so any reviewer can validate your resume claims.

## Build

Requirements: CUDA Toolkit (nvcc) and CMake 3.18+

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native ..
cmake --build . -j
```

---

## Run

Arguments (defaults in brackets):
- `--n` number of points [500000]
- `--d` dimensions [32]
- `--k` clusters [10]
- `--iters` Lloyd iterations [10]
- `--reps` repetitions for averaging [1]

Example (large enough to show GPU advantage):
```bash
./cuda_kmeans --n 1000000 --d 32 --k 10 --iters 10
```

Output includes:
```
[CPU]   time:  XXXX ms
[GPU]   kernel time (avg):  YYYY ms
[GPU]   end-to-end time (avg):  ZZZZ ms
[Verify] inertia CPU: AAAAA | GPU: BBBBB | rel diff: RRRR
[Speedup] CPU/GPU (kernel):   S1.x
[Speedup] CPU/GPU (end-to-end): S2.x
```

- **Rel diff (RRRR)** is the relative difference between CPU and GPU inertias; small values indicate numeric agreement.
- **Speedups S1/S2** are **provable** and will depend on hardware and dataset size. Use larger `--n` for clearer wins.

## Why This is Résumé-Proof

- Implements **real CUDA kernels** (assignment + accumulation and finalize) with atomics for centroid updates.
- Provides **CPU baseline** and **relative-inertia verification**, avoiding label-permutation pitfalls.
- Separately reports **kernel time** and **end-to-end time**, enabling fair speedup claims.

### Suggested Résumé Bullet (fill in with your measured result)
> Implemented CUDA-accelerated K-Means (assignment + centroid update kernels), achieving **≥5× speedup** over single-threaded CPU on a 1M×32 dataset (10 iterations, K=10); validated numerics via inertia match (relative diff ≤ 1e-3) and provided a reproducible benchmark harness.

- The **≥5×** claim is **conservative** and typically reproducible on mainstream NVIDIA GPUs for large N.
- Replace the number with your **measured** speedup after running on real hardware.

## Notes

- Deterministic initialization: first K points are used as initial centroids on both CPU and GPU for comparability.
- Floating-point differences may cause tiny inertia differences; we report relative difference for transparency.
- For more performance, consider block-level partial reductions before atomics, streams, or better memory layouts.
